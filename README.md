# Fastest-Pizza
A practical implementation of Djikstra's Shortest Path algorithm, made for AISSCE Practicals 2018

Created in November-December 2017, with Aditya Chincholi.

[Djikstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) is a well-known shortest path algorithm for graphs, using classes and files. This code is a varient of Dijkstra's original algorithm, and finds the shortest path between two given, user-requested nodes. 

The example use-case here is a command line application to let users find the shortest path between two pre-defined areas in a city, for example to minimise time between ordering and recieving a pizza. Cold pizzas are often as bad as uncommented code.
